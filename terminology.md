- Annuity amount: regular yearly payments one receives
- Consider a person who has an annuity of $1000 and their minimum payment amount is $200. The `PAYMENT_MIN_TO_ANNUITY_RATIO` would be $200/$1000 = 0.2, indicating that their minimum payment is 20% of their annuity. This could suggest that they have a good ability to make the minimum required payment.
- In the context of credit scoring and risk management, "credit" refers to the ability of an individual or an entity to borrow money or obtain goods and services with the promise to repay at a later date. It's essentially a trust extended to a borrower to defer payment for something they receive now. Credit allows individuals and businesses to make purchases or investments they otherwise couldn't afford with their available cash.

- Credit differs from money or other kinds of exchange in that it represents a contractual agreement to repay borrowed funds or fulfill financial obligations in the future. While money serves as a medium of exchange and a store of value, credit allows for the immediate acquisition of goods or services based on the promise of the borrower to repay the lender over time. 

- Credit worthiness, or the ability to obtain credit, is typically measured by assessing various factors, including:
    - Credit History: A record of past borrowing behavior, including repayment history, outstanding debt and types of credit accounts.
    - Income and Employment Stability: Lender often consider a borrower's income level and employment history to assess their ability to repay debts.
    - Debt-to-Income-Ratio (DTI): This ratio compares the borrower's monthly debt obligations to their gross income, providing insights on their ability to acquire additional debt.
    - Credit Utilization: The proportion of a borrower's available credit that they are currently using. High utilization might indicate high financial strain, whereas low utilization suggests responsible credit management.
    - Payment History: A track record of on-time payments on credit accounts, bills and other financial obligations. 

- Credit bureau plays a crucial role in credit scoring and risk assessment by collecting, maintaining, and providing credit information about individuals and businesses to lenders, financial institutions, and other authorized parties. 
    - Data Collection: Credit bureaus gather information from various sources, including lenders, credit card companies, public records (such as bankruptcies, court judgments), and other financial institutions. This information forms the basis of individuals' credit reports.
    - Credit Reporting: Credit bureaus compile this data into credit reports for individuals and businesses. These reports contain detailed information about credit accounts, payment history, outstanding debts, credit inquiries, and public records. Lenders and other authorized parties use these reports to assess credit worthiness and make informed decisions about extending credit.
    - Credit Scoring: FICO scores, VantageScores... quantify an individual's creditworthiness based on their credit history. Lenders use these scores as a standardized way to evaluate the risk of lending to a particular borrower.
    - Risk Management: Credit bureaus help lenders mitigate risk by providing insights into borrowers' credit histories and financial behaviors. Lenders can use this information to make more informed lending decisions, such as setting appropriate interest rates, credit limits, and terms for loans and credit cards.
- Overall, credit bureaus serve as central repositories of credit information, facilitating efficient and standardized credit evaluation processes for lenders and borrowers alike. 

- Terminal node: also known as leaf node is the final node in the decision tree where the final decision or outcome is made. It has no child nodes and represents a specific outcome or class.

- Univariate threshold effect: analyze a single variable for a specific thresh that leads to a change in behavior.
- Bivariate threshold effect: analyze the interactions between two variables and their thresholds.
- Gauging the out-of-sample performance of a model: This process involves evaluating how well the model performs on the data that hasn't been seen during the training process. This typically involves testing the model on a separate dataset, called the "test set" or "validation set", which were not used to train the model. The gold is to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data, providing insights to its predictive capabilities and potential real-world performance. This process helps to validate the model's effectiveness and reliability before deploying in its practical applications.
